# Just Talk

[中文](README.md) · [Website](https://whoamihappyhacking.github.io/just-talk-go/)

Just Talk is a desktop voice input tool. It records audio with a global hotkey, sends it to streaming ASR, and then copies the recognized text to the clipboard or submits it directly into the focused input field.

It is built for people who want to type less and speak more while coding, chatting, writing notes, or working with long text.

## Features

- Global hotkey recording with `toggle` and `hold` modes.
- Voice hotkeys are limited to keys suitable for global shortcuts: modifiers, function keys, Tab, CapsLock, arrow/navigation keys, and similar non-text keys. Letters, digits, punctuation, Space, and other text-producing keys are rejected.
- Doubao streaming ASR with optimized bidirectional streaming and second-pass recognition.
- Clipboard copy and automatic text submission.
- Always-on-top recording status overlay for Wayland, X11, macOS, and Windows.
- TUI configuration for hotkeys, mode, auto-submit, stop delay, hotwords, and related settings.
- ASR hotwords for project names, people names, English terms, and domain-specific vocabulary.
- Usage statistics for total sessions, total recognized characters, average speed, and recent speed.

## Platform Status

Linux, macOS, and Windows desktops are supported:

| Platform | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux Wayland | Supported | Works with Sway / wlroots; hotkeys use evdev and require input permissions |
| Linux X11 | Supported | Uses native X11 global hotkeys |
| macOS | Supported | Global hotkeys use CGEventTap, recording uses CoreAudio, clipboard uses NSPasteboard, and overlay uses AppKit NSPanel |
| Windows 10/11 | Supported | Global key polling with a low-level keyboard-hook edge fallback, WinMM recording, Unicode clipboard, SendInput auto-submit, and a Win32 status overlay |

## Build

Just Talk uses native platform APIs. Linux and macOS builds require cgo; Windows uses direct Win32 calls from Go and does not require cgo.

Linux build dependencies:

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S --needed go gcc libx11 libxtst libxext wayland

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install golang-go build-essential libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxext-dev libxinerama-dev libwayland-dev
```

macOS build dependencies:

```bash
# Apple Command Line Tools provide clang and the macOS SDK. Full Xcode is not required.
xcode-select --install
```

Windows build dependency:

```powershell
# Install Go 1.25 or later. No ffmpeg, SoX, or C compiler is required.
winget install --id GoLang.Go --exact
```

Build for the current platform:

```bash
cd just-talk-go
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o build/just-talk ./cmd/just-talk
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd just-talk-go
go build -o build\just-talk.exe .\cmd\just-talk
```

Install to `~/.local/bin/just-talk`:

```bash
# Make sure ~/.local/bin is in PATH. If not, add this line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc.
# export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
build/just-talk --install
# or
make install
```

macOS must be built on macOS. The project does not provide a non-cgo build.

Install on Windows to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Just Talk\just-talk.exe`:

```powershell
.\build\just-talk.exe --install
# If the directory is not already in PATH, follow the note printed by the command.
```

### Nix / NixOS

This repository provides a flake package, overlay, NixOS module, and Home Manager module:

```bash
nix run github:whoamihappyhacking/just-talk-go
nix build github:whoamihappyhacking/just-talk-go
```

NixOS:

```nix
{
  inputs.just-talk.url = "github:whoamihappyhacking/just-talk-go";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, just-talk, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        just-talk.nixosModules.default
        { programs.just-talk.enable = true; }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Home Manager:

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.just-talk.homeManagerModules.default ];

  programs.just-talk = {
    enable = true;
    autoStart = true;
    extraArgs = [ "--no-tui" "--backend" "wayland" ];
  };
}
```

Wayland global hotkeys require the current user to have read access to `/dev/input/event*`. The uinput fallback for auto-submit requires access to `/dev/uinput`.

## Release Downloads

GitHub Releases provide prebuilt archives for:

- Linux amd64 / arm64
- macOS Intel / Apple Silicon
- Windows amd64 / arm64
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` checksum verification

The release workflow uses GoReleaser v2 with the official `goreleaser/goreleaser-action`. Linux, macOS, and Windows binaries are built natively on matching GitHub-hosted runners. Maintainers can build and publish a release by pushing a `v*` tag, for example:

```bash
git tag v0.7.0
git push origin v0.7.0
```

## Usage

Start the TUI:

```bash
just-talk
```

Run without the TUI:

```bash
just-talk --no-tui
```

Force a backend:

```bash
just-talk --backend wayland
just-talk --backend x11
```

Windows selects its native backend automatically. Check the microphone and configuration before first use:

```powershell
.\build\just-talk.exe --doctor
```

## Configuration

Default config path:

```text
# Linux / macOS
~/.config/just-talk/config.toml

# Windows
%APPDATA%\just-talk\config.toml
```

Recommended hotkey config:

```toml
[voice]
mode = "toggle"
push_to_talk = "Alt+Super"
```

`Alt+Super` with `toggle` mode is recommended. Press once to start recording, then press again to stop. This avoids hold-mode key conflicts with desktop environments or focused input fields. On Windows, the low-level keyboard hook only observes key edges and never consumes or replays modifiers, so standalone `Alt`, `Super`, and shortcuts such as `Alt+Tab` retain their normal system behavior. Modifier combinations require the exact configured set, and hook fallback state is checked against the unsuppressed physical key state so separate single-key presses cannot be combined into the shortcut.

Voice hotkeys only support keys suitable for global shortcuts:

- Supported: modifier-only combinations, such as `Alt+Super` and `Ctrl+Alt+Shift`.
- Supported: function keys `F1` through `F24`, such as `F9` and `Alt+F8`.
- Supported: non-text control and navigation keys, such as `Tab`, `Enter`, `Escape`, `Backspace`, `CapsLock`, `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Insert`, and `Delete`.
- Not supported: letters, digits, punctuation, Space, numpad digits, and numpad symbols that can enter text, such as `Alt+G`, `G`, `Alt+1`, and `Alt+Space`.

Hotword example:

```toml
[voice]
hotwords = ["Wayland", "Sway", "wl-copy", "wtype", "just-talk-go"]
```

macOS hotkey example:

```toml
[voice]
# Option is Alt; Command/Cmd is Super.
push_to_talk = "Option+Command"
```

On Windows, `Win` and `Super` both refer to the Windows logo key. If recording is unavailable, allow desktop applications to access the microphone under Windows Settings > Privacy & security > Microphone.
